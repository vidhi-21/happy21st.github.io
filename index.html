<h2><u>MY FEELINGS</u></h2>
<p>
	Babe! I dont know where to start from and where to end at. Every second of the time spend with you have been so precious and worth mentioning that leaving out on any would be a sin. You have done so much for me, from taking care to pampering me, you fulfill all my wishes which you could. You go beyond your means to keep me happy and I would be ever grateful to you for that. Thank you so much for all those chocolates and gifts. Thank you so much for keeping track of all my big and small wishes. Thank you for being there. Thank you for handling me. Thank you for caring so much. Thank you for everything yaar. 
</p>

<p>
	You make me feel lovely. Thank you for providing me with far more than I could have imagined. I am grateful for what we have and everything we will have. You are the only man with whom I would ever want to share my life. I can't picture what it would be like if we were to be apart. I'm not even going to try to think about it. I can't stop thinking about you. You are the one and only love of my life. I'm in love with you. I shall always adore you until the day I die. Hopefully, I'll still have you by my side when that day arrives, and your face will be the last one I see. </p>

	<p> I simply wanted to say something normal and lovable to make you feel that you're beautiful and to put that smile on your face that I adore. I want everyone to know how important you are to me. I've been flying on Cloud 9 since you entered my life, and I haven't come down yet. I'm still not sure what I did to be so fortunate to have you in my life, my dream realised... However, I am quite grateful. We have grown so much in the short time we've been together...with many more on the way...and I can't wait to see what the future holds for us.</p>

	<p>The only thing I want in my life is for you to be here. Even if I don't always express myself, if you look into my eyes, you'll see an ocean of love, respect, and care reserved exclusively for you! Even if I travelled the entire universe in search of the ideal boyfriend, I would never find someone like you. You were created by God specifically to come into my life and make it lovely. I adore You a lot! Every morning, I know there will be a nice romantic text from you waiting for me on my phone. You are the centre of my days, and you are the centre of my nights. And there is only one thing that exists between them — LOVE!</p>

	<p>God has bestowed many blessings onto me, but the most lovely of them all has been you. You have shown me such love and care over the years that it can only be compared to heaven. I will love you to the end of my days. I know I always say "I love you," but it's not enough. Those three words are insufficient to express how I feel about you. You make my stomach flip and my hands tremble. I've never loved anyone as much as you, and I doubt I'll ever love anyone else as much as you. You're everything I've ever desired and needed in a partner. I love you; you are everything to me, my entire heart and universe!
